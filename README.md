# To-Do-List
This is my first JS project.  
What does "To-Do-List" do?
Create a to-do action item list.
User can click on the "done" button when an action item has been completed.  The said item will be crossed out but not removed.
User can delete an action item by cliking on the "delete" button.
This does not retain items to local storage, thus when the page is refreshed, the list is gone. 
Saving to local storage will be added later among other new fearures.
